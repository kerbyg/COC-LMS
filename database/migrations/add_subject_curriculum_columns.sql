-- Migration: Add curriculum columns to subject table
-- Date: 2026-02-18
-- Description: Adds program_id, year_level, and semester
--              columns needed for curriculum management.
-- ============================================================
-- Run this in phpMyAdmin (SQL tab) on the cit_lms database.
-- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS pattern).
